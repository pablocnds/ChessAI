# ChessAI

Work in progress implementation of chess for AI / ML training. 

By default it only simulates the moves without displaying them in order to boost the performance during the AI training, but the board state can be shown using the to_string method which will output a string representation of the board with its pieces.

The implementation is focused on keeping an abstracted code structure, but performance is also taken into account.
