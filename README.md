# ChessAI

Work in progress implementation of chess for AI training. 

For now it only simulates the moves without displaying them in order to boost the performance during the AI training, but the board state can be shown using the to_string method which will output a string representation of the board with its pieces.

The implementation is focused on performance while keeping an abstracted code structure.
